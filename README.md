# Big Data Processing with Hadoop - A Complete Reference Guide
**Design, build, and execute effective big data strategies with advanced Hadoop concepts**

Apache Hadoop is one of the most popular big data solutions for distributed storage and data processing. This Learning Path will empower you to easily build solutions with Hadoop, along with a host of other big data tools.

This Hadoop Learning Path begins by helping you gain a complete understanding of data life cycle management. You’ll learn how to design real-time streaming pipelines by using Apache Spark and build efficient enterprise search solutions using Elasticsearch. You’ll also understand how you can visualize your data using tools such as Apache Superset. Through this Learning Path, you’ll get well versed with techniques for deploying your big data solutions on the cloud using Apache Ambari to manage and administer your Hadoop cluster. As you advance, you’ll even discover how to address common challenges like using Kafka efficiently, designing low latency, and handling high data volumes.

By the end of this Learning Path, you’ll have a complete understanding of how components in the Hadoop ecosystem are effectively integrated to implement a fast and reliable data pipeline.
